Provisions for people of determination Inclusive education for people of determination Centres for people of determination Provisions for people of determination The term special education describes the programmes and services designed for people of determination (people with special needs) in order to ensure that all students can reach their full potential. The term 'special educational needs' is used to describe the educational needs of any one with a disability, disorder, difficulty, impairment, exceptionality or any other factor that may affect a student's access to learning and educational performance. The government of the UAE strongly supports education and learning services for people of determination. In November 2006, the UAE signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Optional Protocol . Federal Law No. 29 of 2006 , is the first law in the UAE to protect the rights of people of determination. Article 12 of the law provides: the country guarantees people with special needs equal opportunities in education within all educational, vocational training, adult education and continuing education institutions in regular classes or special classes with the availability of curriculum in sign language or Braille and or any other methods as appropriate. Ministry of Education's (MoE) strategy is to adapt public schools to facilitate education for people of determination. Accordingly, people of determination are entitled to enrol in any school, without exception. These students are catered for by Department of Special Education, which was established in 2008 by MoE. This Department promotes the rights of people of determination and ensures that they have access to the same educational opportunities as students in the regular education system. Education is of the pillars of the ' National Policy for Empowering People of Determination '. T he government will provide an integrative education system in public and vocational education and adapt school curricula to cater their needs. It will also provide qualified teachers and specialists, appropriate supportive technologies and learning materials. Inclusive education for people of determination The UAE has made tangible efforts to include people of determination in mainstream education. These efforts are reflected in the Ministerial Resolution No. 647 for the year 2020 on the policy of inclusive education (PDF in Arabic, 500 KB), which directs government schools to adapt themselves to cater to the needs of people of determination and provide them with the best education services. Additionally, the ministry established the People of Determination Department (formerly known as the Special Education Department), in 2008 to protect the rights of students of determination and provide them with equal opportunities as other students. The ministry also provides all supporting services (mentioned below) to students of determination for free in government schools. The ministry provides specialised teachers with high behavioural skills that enable them to care for people of determination. It also launched several skill training programmes that include clear instructions on dealing with people with visual and hearing impairment. It launched programmes for teachers to identify talents, understand sign language for those with hearing difficulties, and know how to properly deal with language disorders experienced by children. The ministry has established support centres across the UAE to follow up on the progress of students of determination before and after inclusion within schools. These centres provide different services such as diagnosis of students with disabilities and learning difficulties, providing recommendations, assisting parents in dealing with their child's condition, and advising support services suitable for their children. Services and facilities for students of determination The schools are required to provide the following facilities for students of determination: wheelchair ramps and elevators, toilets, buses, cars and parking spaces prepared for students with physical disabilities special education resource rooms and sensory and comprehensive rooms specialised human cadres such as: special education teacher, teacher assistant, escort, sign language interpreter, Braille education specialist, visual impairment specialist, psychologist, speech and language specialist, special education specialist assessment and diagnosis of students of determination by a multidisciplinary team support services and individual and group treatment and rehabilitation sessions, according to their needs such as speech and language sessions, Braille education sessions, behaviour modification sessions, sign language sessions counselling, awareness and guidance sessions for parents of students of determination devices and assistive technologies according to their special needs workshops and courses for administration staff, teachers, guides, specialists and parents of students.

Dubai Inclusive Education Policy Framework In support of the ‘ My community… a city for every one’ initiative and Dubai Disability Strategy 2020 which aims for Dubai to become disability-friendly by 2020, Knowledge and Human Development Authority - KHDA launched the Dubai Inclusive Education Policy Framework (PDF). The framework provides valuable information about the standards required in the area of educational practice and offers clear guidance on the actions to be taken to ensure the provision of quality inclusive services for students of determination (disabled or people with special needs). The framework applies to all education sectors across Dubai. It includes early childhood services, special needs centres and primary, secondary and higher education providers. It also empowers education providers, regulatory authorities and governing bodies in Dubai to closely monitor progress and compliance. Equal opportunities MoE offers several training programmes and facilities targeting children of determination, their parents and kindergarten teachers. Programmes include guidance for dealing with people with visual and hearing disabilities, talent identification programmes, getting familiar with sign language for the deaf and handling speech and language disorders in kindergarten-going children. Support centres Ministry of Education has set up support centres to follow up and evaluate the progress of people of determination before and after integration in schools. These centres provide various services including individual diagnosis of students with disabilities and learning difficulties, recommendations, helping and supporting parents to deal with the child's situation and directing them to sources with appropriate support services for their child. National institutes concerned with people of determination can benefit from annual grants and rewards and professional programmes for qualifying experts in the field of special education.

Enhancing the judicial system Providing access to laws Spreading legal awareness Providing legal aid and guidance Enhancing the judicial system The UAE Government made serious efforts to evolve its judicial system, realising its role in maintaining order and security in the country. Since 1971, the government has set up many courts and public prosecution in all emirates. It has enacted many legislations to accommodate the ever-changing socio-economic needs of the UAE. All the laws issued in the UAE are published in the Official Gazette (with their amendments). In 2012, the number of personnel in the judiciary reached 287 members from 228 in 2008. By this time, Emiratisation increased by 72 per cent in this sector from 2008. Further, the number of registered lawyers in Ministry of Justice reached 783 by March 2016 (764 are Emiratis and the rest are GCC nationals).

A number of initiatives were launched to increase the level of legal awareness in the society, which include: Meezan magazine The UAE's Ministry of Justice issues ' Meezan ', a monthly issue about the UAE's judicial developments, legislations and awareness campaigns. Tweeter Visit Launched by Dubai Courts, Tweeter Visit aims to open new communication channels with various sectors of society in an efficient way. It invites residents to have a tour so they can be introduced to the UAE's legal system.

It also offers training for government bodies' personnel, whose jobs are related to law and judicial fields, as well as, scientific research and its usage within the law and judicial fields. Raising children's legal knowledge Juvenile offences make up a significant percentage of all cases examined by prosecutors in the UAE. Studies showed that juveniles tended to carry out crime because of a low level of awareness about the seriousness of such misdemeanours under the law. The offences were often committed on the spur of the moment. By teaching youth about the law at an early age, youngsters will be more likely to turn into responsible adults. Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) had declared 2015 as ' child's legal knowledge year' . The initiative aimed at teaching youngsters about their legal responsibilities. The campaigns included short videos about wrong actions and their damaging results, like one who fights in school, uses the mobile phone to insult others or causes disturbance.

It can be used as an identity proof to get government services, for voting in the elections of Federal National Council, as a travel document for UAE citizens to travel within the GCC and as a document to pass immigration through the eGates and smart gates at several airports in the UAE. Further, the identity card is designed to reinforce security for its holders, guarding them against fraud and illicit transactions. Read about the Emirates ID’s f eatures and benefits and how to apply for an Emirates ID . eSignature and digital certification What is an eSignature? An eSignature is used in electronic messages to identify the signatory (the sender of the message) and distinguish them from everyone else. An eSignature also proves that the message received is the same message that was sent by the signatory and that nothing has been added, deleted or amended. It may consist of letters, marks, symbols, numbers, sounds or images. An eSignature is as binding as a signature executed by hand. Federal Decree by Law No. 46 of 2021 on Electronic Transactions and Trust Services (PDF, 4.4 MB, available in Arabic only) approves the use of eSignatures in the UAE. To create an eSignature, you need an electronic signature creation device, and a digital certificate to be authorised to use this device. Certification services providers issue digital certificates. These certificates confirm the identity of the signature device holder. What is a digital certificate? A digital certificate is a certificate issued by a certification service provider, which confirms the identity of the person or entity holding an electronic signature creation device. An electronic signature creation device is a uniquely configured device or electronic information that enables a person to apply his e-signature in the form of electronic keys and symbols. What is a digital certification service provider (DCSP)? A digital certification service provider is an accredited or authorised natural person or legal entity that issues digital certificates and offers digital signature-related services. How to apply for a DCSP license? You can apply for a DCSP license through Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). Obtaining a licence from TRA is required for all digital certificate service providers operating in the UAE with respect to eRecords, eDocuments and eSignatures related to eTransactions and/or eCommerce .

The tourist must present a valid travel document to be scanned for use on the payment system. The shop assistant will capture the tourist’s information using the Planet system.

Unofficial abbreviations include Dh and Dhs. The dirham is subdivided into 100 fils. History of the UAE Dirham The ‘Currency Board’ was established as per Union Law No. 2 of 1973 , which was replaced by Law No. 10 of 1980 concerning the Central Bank, Monetary System and Organization of Banking (PDF, 550 KB) . The Currency Board issued the national currency that replaced the Bahraini Dinar and the Qatari and Dubai Riyal currencies that were in use at the time as per the website of the UAE Central Bank . The UAE dirham was introduced in circulation for the first time on 19 May 1973 . The Qatar and Dubai riyal were in circulation since 1966 in all of the emirates except Abu Dhabi, where the dirham replaced the Bahraini dinar. Coins Coins are in the denominations of AED 1, 50 fils and 25 fils. The coins of 1, 5 and 10 fils are not used in everyday life. So, all amounts are rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of 25 fils. Since 1976, the Currency Board and then Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates have minted several commemorative coins celebrating different events of the United Arab Emirates as below: CBUAE to issue silver coin to commemorate first Emirati astronaut's space mission - WAM Reissuance of Commemorative Coins in honour of Founding Father – WAM Central Bank issues commemorative coin on Asian Cup – WAM Bank notes The first dirham notes, introduced in 1973, were in denominations of AED 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100.

They were similar to those that are in circulation today. Explore more about the UAE’s currency in the Currency Museum and the tourist guide training and licensing manual issued by Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism . The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates issues the country's banknotes. To combat counterfeiting, a watermark of the national emblem appears on the obverse of each note. Commemorative coins Alongside currency used for everyday transactions, the CBUAE also mints commemorative coins to celebrate the many highlights and achievements of the United Arab Emirates. Government entities, banks and the CBUAE are all entitled to request CBUAE to issue a commemorative gold, silver or circulation coin to mark an important occasion. Read more about currency and coins.

DubaiNEXT DubaiNEXT is a digital crowdfunding platform from Dubai Government. It was launched to facilitate Dubai-based individuals and companies who have creative projects to start a campaign through the platform and ask the UAE’s community to fund their business idea and turn it into a venture. DubaiNEXT is based on the ‘All-or-Nothing’ model, where a campaigner sets a fundraising goal, but keeps nothing unless the goal is achieved. After the campaigner meets his funding goal, the amount will be released to him through Dubai SME . If the campaign does not reach the funded goal, the contributed amount will be refunded to the contributors. The campaigner will get to keep full ownership of his project. Contributors can choose from a variety of unique rewards offered by the campaign owner. The ‘Dubai Next’ platform aims to encourage youth and start-ups to obtain community support through crowdfunding. It envisions to empower a generation that is capable of innovating to succeed in a competitive commercial environment, thus reinforcing the fundamental role of SMEs in economic development.

Environment, energy and ‘We the UAE 2031’ vision Environment Vision 2030 Entities in charge of environment Environmental awareness Environment, energy and ‘We the UAE 2031’ vision Under the ‘ Forward diplomacy’ pillar of ‘ We the UAE 2031’ vision , the UAE seeks to be a leading country in supporting the global agenda for environmental sustainability, pioneering green innovation and a clean and zero-emissions future. It aims to: make quantum leaps towards ‘Net Zero’, establishing itself as an environmentally responsible nation and a role model for adopting eco-friendly economic and social best practices and serve as a centre for innovation in sustainability by utilising science and technology, knowledge and expertise to drive the green revolution forward. Environment Vision 2030 Read about the Environment Vision 2030 for the emirate of Abu Dhabi. Entities in charge of environment Ministry of Climate Change and Environment Ministry of Climate Change and Environment is the federal authority for environmental planning and action in the UAE. In collaboration with the competent local authorities concerned with environment, it works on developing environmental programmes and initiatives that aim to contribute to the sustainability of water, enhance food security, raise the rates of bio-security and enhance environmental security. The action plans of the ministry emerge from its vision to ensure sustainable environment for life. The ministry launched National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017–2050 (PDF, 3 MB) which serves as a roadmap to bolster nationwide actions for climate mitigation. Through this plan, the UAE will further strive to be at the frontline of global efforts to prove that climate action can go hand in hand with continuous economic development. The document serves as a complementary plan of action that specifically addresses climate change. Other entities In addition to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, there is a competent authority for environmental protection in each emirate. They are: Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi Dubai Municipality Environment & Protected Areas Authority - Sharjah Ajman Municipality Umm Al Quwain Municipality Environment Protection and Development Authority - Ras Al Khaimah Fujairah Municipality . Environmental awareness Environmental awareness aims at developing the culture of the society regarding environment and promoting environmental behaviour of individuals, which helps to conserve and properly manage natural resources. The bodies concerned with the environment protection organise educational campaigns at the emirate or federal level in coordination with the respective federal agency. The type and slogans of these campaigns are based on the needs of the UAE's community in the areas of environmental awareness and education. In recent years, environmental education has become one of the salient elements in curriculum development in the United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, efforts have been directed to include environmental content in school curricula and textbooks. Therefore, Ministry of Education has been keen to incorporate the environmental dimension in school curricula of all stages, by addressing the environmental issues that affect student's environment, in order to open the way for discussion on sustainable solutions. As part of the involvement of global stakeholders in the wheel of promoting environmental knowledge, the Eco-Schools Initiative was launched. It is a global initiative led by the Emirates Wildlife Society in collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), aiming to encourage environmental action in schools.

Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) for decarbonisation Green Barjeel Research project Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge The UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA) Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) for decarbonisation Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) developed the ‘ Artificial Intelligence Operating System’ (AIOS) to reduce the high cost of artificial intelligence (AI) programmes by decreasing the amount of energy that is spent in their development. The AIOS aims to support data centres at MBZUAI and in the UAE with the ability to enter ‘eco-mode’ for AI training and reduce energy waste. Current AI computing is extremely environmentally unfriendly. For example, training GPT3 once can cost as much energy as the home electricity usage of a small city (150,000 homes) and millions of dollars. The AIOS technology will reduce the energy and time required for AI computing by making models smaller, faster, and less reliant on high-end hardware, while also making them more performant and easier to adapt to changing environments and users. The AIOS can form the foundation of next-generation AI software production via automatic code generation, federated and collaborative machine learning, and standardised and certifiable software engineering, which will be used across industries such as energy, agriculture, water and food, and more.

Green Barjeel Research project The UAE’s Green Barjeel Research project aims to leverage innovative methods to grow microalgae biomass with a high lipid content in tower-shaped structures. The project involves collecting algae from the UAE’s desert ponds and cultivating them. The process offers lot of benefits, including sequestering CO2 and removing dust particles from the ambient air to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The structures can serve as passive cooling systems for use in public spaces. The project also seeks to examine and classify the diverse indigenous algal strains and test the potential of using them to produce biofuel and biofertilizers. The scope includes an experimental study on the safe and sustainable removal of Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Sulfur oxides (SOx) from the atmosphere. The first model of the Green Barjeel Research station is located in the garden of Ministry of Climate Change and Environment office in Dubai. The station is equipped with sensors that collect a series of environmentally sensitive data, such as ambient temperature, water temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for monitoring and displaying it on an electronic smart board. Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge The UAE’s ‘ Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge’ aims to increase the engagement of the private sector in the country’s decarbonisation drive, in line with the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative . The pledge forms the basis of future collaborations between the private sector, non-governmental organisations (NGO) and international organisations, which aim to support private sector entities in implementing their net zero plans. The pledge is part of the initiatives of Ministry of Climate Change and Environment aimed at scaling up the UAE’s climate action, in response to the call of the Glasgow Climate Pact - (PDF, 111 KB) for countries to adopt higher GHG emission reduction targets. The UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA) Established by the UAE, the Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA) is a non-partisan, climate action entity that brings together members of the public and private sector to drive the UAE’s commitment towards net zero by 2050. In the lead-up to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) , the UICCA will establish an independent body that enables collaboration, cooperation and innovation. This includes advice and recommendations on positive climate actions to reduce the climate-related risk for the UAE before, during and after COP28.

The UAE’s Natural Wonders Topography Ecosystems Preserving biodiversity City Biodiversity Index in Abu Dhabi Preserving plants' species The UAE’s Natural Wonders In July 2018, Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) launched a three-phase national project titled ‘The UAE’s Natural Wonders’. The first phase of the project raises awareness about the UAE’s 43 nature reserves, which make up 14 per cent of the UAE’s territory. Read on . Topography The UAE is largely an arid land with vast sand deserts, but is also characterised by sand dunes, oases, rock mountains, valleys, marshes and mangroves and salt plains. The oases are mostly of date palms; most oases are located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. Along the eastern borders are the Hajjar Mountains that run north-south. These mountains are complemented by valleys (called wadis in Arabic). The wadis are usually dry. However, in cooler months when it rains, they flourish with brooks and pools. Mangroves (called qurms in Arabic) form an integral part of the marine ecosystem. Salt plains (called sabkhas in Arabic) are also a common feature. The present-day sabkha started to form some 4000 years ago. Ecosystems The UAE's natural environment is diverse with four major varieties of ecosystems: desert ecosystem mountain ecosystem coastal and marine ecosystem Wetlands ecosystem. Desert ecosystem Desert is the dominating landscape, stretching from the southern coast of Arabian Gulf to the uninhabited sands of the Empty Quarter (Rub Al Khali). To the east is the gravel plains bordering the Hajjar Mountains. Mountains ecosystem Hajjar's rugged mountains rise sharply to an elevation of 2000 metres. Wadis or dry riverbeds open out onto fertile plains. Coastal and marine ecosystem The UAE's seas are home to a variety of fish, invertebrates and other marine animals. The southwest waters of Abu Dhabi and Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali in Dubai and Sir Bu Na'air Island and Khor Kalba in Sharjah are recognised by the UAE for their rich and unique environmental biodiversity and are of global biological and ecological importance. The marine habitat protects beaches from coastal erosion and plays a role in climate change mitigation. Natural habitats of marine organisms are governed mostly by the type of surface, tides, water current, degree of wave exposure, temperature and salinity. The marine life of the UAE is rich in fish, plants and corals. Over 500 different species of fish inhabit the Gulf waters, with many more existing in the Indian Ocean. The Arabian Gulf is blessed with large populations of dugongs, dolphins (eight species) and marine turtles. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the most common and feeds on the extensive sea grass beds found in shallow waters. Both green and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles are known to nest on the beaches of UAE's main coast and islands. Coral reefs and mangrove creeks are habitats for many marine creatures. These areas are important fish breeding grounds and feeding areas and they protect the shores from coastal erosion. Damage to coastal developments, fishing nets, anchors and ignorant divers cause destruction of these areas. Coral reefs are sensitive to their environment. They take decades to regrow. Dominant marine life forms in the UAE coasts include fish, marine mammals and marine reptiles. Fish At the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, the constriction and resultant strong currents of the Strait of Hormuz, influence the distribution of many species. Marine mammals Marine mammals are relatively common in the UAE's waters and include a great diversity. The two groups of marine mammals that are represented here are the whales and dolphins of the order Cetacea, and dugong of the order Sirenia. Marine reptiles These include sea turtles and sea snakes. Sea turtles Of the seven recognised species of marine turtles in the world, four live in the waters of the UAE. They are: The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) The hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) The loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) The huge leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) The olive ridley sea turtle ( L epidochelys olivacea) Sea Snakes Sea Snakes are found in the UAE's seas. There are at least seven species, all of which belong to one family, the Hydrophiidae. They are excellent swimmers and the laterally flattened tail makes them easily recognisable and distinguishes them from eels. Sourced from: Jewels of the UAE - Arkive.org For further readings: The Environmental Atlas of Abu Dhabi emirate The UAE's coasts The UAE has two coastlines. The longer coast, at over 700 kilometres, excluding islands, faces in a north to north-westerly direction into the southern Arabian Gulf whilst the other, much shorter, coast, approximately 70 kilometres long, faces eastwards into the Gulf of Oman. Much of the Arabian Gulf coastline is low-lying, flat and bordered by shallow water. While the coast of Gulf of Oman is rugged and eroding, with a higher proportion of hard rock. The differences in climate along the two coasts has led to assemblages of marine organisms that are somewhat different, although both are of Indian Ocean origin. Wetlands The UAE has 10 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance , Ramsar sites, with a surface area of 39,166 hectares. Some of these are: Al Wathba Wetland Reserve, Abu Dhabi Bul Syayeef, Abu Dhabi Jebel Ali Wetland Sanctuary, Dubai Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, Dubai Mangrove and Alhafeya Protected Area in Khor Kalba, Sharjah Sir Bu Nair Island Protected Area, Sharjah Al-Zora Protected Area, Ajman Wadi Wurayah National Park, Fujairah.

The Abu Dhabi City Biodiversity Index will help the emirate to: benchmark its biodiversity conservation efforts evaluate progress in reducing the rate of biodiversity loss in urban ecosystems measure the ecological footprint of cities. Cities will use this index as a benchmark for further improvements in improving the role of cities, such as Abu Dhabi, in playing a global role in promoting and conserving biodiversity. Read related news coverage on WAM . Preserving plants' species Gheras In order to preserve its biodiversity and protect and restore the natural habitats of its local plants, the UAE created a database of local plant species and made it available to the public. . An app titled Gherasuae is available on App Store and Google Play . In 2014, the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment completed the first phase of its date palm tree identification through DNA profiling through a collaboration with the UAE University. The projects aims to offer all kinds of support to preserve, identify and classify all genetic assets of date palm trees. It also aims to establish a reference database for all types of palm trees found in the UAE, as well as identify and document the extent of their diversity. The project will also help increase the contribution of palm tree planting and date production to the country's gross domestic product. In addition, many initiatives were launched to preserve the UAE's plant species, including the establishment of 'gene' banks for plants' genetic resources. One initiative will be implemented by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), which is set to document and preserve plants through establishing Abu Dhabi Plant Genetics Resources Centre. The purpose of the centre is to collect and document native plants so that if any species became extinct in the wild it could be cultivated in captivity and reintroduced back to nature. The other is being undertaken at the UAE University in collaboration with the Khalifa Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.

Efforts to manage waste Waste to energy projects Treatment of wastewater Transporting hazardous waste Sea dumping and pollution Reducing the use of plastic Efforts to manage waste Due to population growth and economic activities, the quantities of wastes in the UAE have increased in the last decade. Most of the waste ends up in municipal landfills or dumpsites, where organic waste generates a large amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Currently, little of the waste is burnt and the rate of municipal waste recycling has been rapidly rising. Waste management in the country is coordinated through local authorities. Waste issues are handled through recycling and converting waste to energy and resources, new technologies and improved waste separation and collection systems. The UAE aims to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. The UAE issued Cabinet Resolution No. (39) regarding the executive regulations of Federal Resolution No. (12) of 2018 on the integrated waste management that seeks to regulate the waste management process and standardize the mechanisms and methods of proper waste disposal in line with best practices with the aim of protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health. Waste management in Abu Dhabi The Government of Abu Dhabi established the Centre of Waste Management Tadweer in 2008. The company is responsible for the policy, strategy and contractual systems of waste management across the emirate. Waste management in Dubai Dubai Municipality's Waste Management Department prepared the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Master Plan in 2012 with an aim to reduce the amount of waste being sent to the landfills to zero in 20 years by using an integrated and innovative approach. Dubai Municipality has announced that it will establish the largest plant in the Middle East to convert solid waste into energy at a cost of AED 2 billion in the Warsan district. The move also comes in line with the National Agenda to reduce the landfill by 75 per cent by 2021, in addition to protecting the environment from methane gas emitted by the landfill. The implementation period will take three years and the plant will be operational in the second quarter of 2020 during which it will receive 2,000 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste per day in the first phase to produce 60 megawatts. The waste incineration project is the first of the four projects to produce green energy. Dubai Municipality, in co-ordination with Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, conducted studies to achieve the strategy of Dubai for Clean Energy, to produce 7 per cent of Dubai's total energy from clean energy sources by 2020. Waste management in Sharjah The emirate of Sharjah set up a municipal waste management company Bee'ah (the Arabic word for environment) in 2007 in the form of a public-private partnership. In October 2011, Sharjah announced an ambitious plan for 100 per cent landfill diversion by 2015. To attain this goal, Bee'ah developed a state-of-the-art waste management centre to process and recycle waste. In 2012, the company introduced two-stream waste collection and a new tipping fee structure to incentivise waste reduction and to closely regulate landfill contents. Improved blue and green coloured, odour-proof bins have been deployed across the emirate. Waste to energy projects Read about waste to energy projects .

Among the actions included in the policy are the provision of mental health services to outpatients, the development of mental health units for inpatients in mental health hospitals and the establishment of community mental health services, including outreach services, care and home support services and community rehabilitation. Efforts to address mental health issues In early 2019, Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) announced the launch of a number of digital solutions technologies in the mental and psychological field, which will lead to a quantum leap in the clinical practices field. These digital solutions include the treatment by using virtual reality technology to help understand schizophrenia and to learn more about the suffering of patients with this disease, through the use of Gear by Oculus technology. In addition, MoHAP, represented by the Specialized Care Department of Hospitals Sector, and in collaboration with Sharjah Roads & Transport Authority, organised awareness lectures in English and Urdu to raise Sharjah taxi drivers’ awareness about mental disorders. A medical team from MoHAP conducted examinations for 100 drivers to assess their acquaintance with mental disorders causes and treatment. The team distributed mental-disorders-related brochures including how to control these disorders and the places where drivers can go for diagnosis and treatment. The Mental Health Program at Abu Dhabi Public Health Center aims to develop projects and provide resources to promote community mental health and reduce self and social stigma around mental disorders and associate treatment.

Drug rehabilitation National Rehabilitation Center (NRC) in Abu Dhabi undertakes research on issues related to drug-abuse and offers rehabilitation and treatment to drug abusers. Read about: Parent's Guide to Drug Abuse and Prevention (in Arabic PDF, 7.40 MB) - UAE's Ministry of Interior International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, 26 June – UN Organization Controlled medicines The UAE is a signatory to several international conventions on narcotic and psychotropic substances (PDF). The conventions involve applying internationally valid control measures to ensure that narcotic and psychotropic substances are not freely available to layman. The conventions aim to: make narcotic and psychotropic substances available only for medical and scientific purposes prevent their diversion into illicit channels eliminate drug trafficking and abuse. Federal Law No. 14 of 1995 describes how these conventions are applied in the UAE and Federal Law No. 4 of 1983 describes the basic requirements for prescribing and supplying prescription medicines. Controlled drugs are those that, if not used responsibly, can lead to addiction and have the potential to be abused by individuals. Narcotic and psychotropic (controlled drug - Class A or CDa) drugs are controlled. Controlled medicines are administered to patients of acute and chronic diseases in accordance with modern medical practice. They are mostly administered to in-patients. Controlled drug - Class B (CDb) are semi-controlled. Majority of medicines which are used worldwide are available in community pharmacies and hospitals in the UAE. However, narcotic, psychotropic and other controlled drugs/medicines of class A or B are neither freely available in the UAE, nor can they be freely imported into the country. They fall under the controlled/restricted items' category. You may bring in other prescribed medicines for personal use in normal quantity. To import some medicines , you are required to receive permit from Ministry of Health and Prevention. Prescription of controlled medicines Narcotic prescriptions In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a narcotic can be prescribed only by a physician licensed by HAAD for an in-patient and must be written on the approved narcotic prescription form. Private sector prescriptions for out-patient narcotic supply are not usually allowed. However, exceptions will be considered following a request from a medical director. Psychotropic prescriptions In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a psychotropic for an out-patient can be prescribed only by a HAAD-licensed physician. There are special requirements for the psychotropics known as CDa, previously known as 'Registered Prescription (RP)' or 'Group 4' drugs. These must be prescribed on the official psychotropic prescription form. Currently, there are UAE federal restrictions on the duration of prescription supply of CDa and CDb drugs and this depends upon the status of the prescribing physician. In accordance with Federal Law No. 4 of 1983, there are special requirements for an out-patient prescription written for a CDa. There are no special prescription-requirements for ordering psychotropic CDb drugs for in or out-patients and therefore these are ordered using a normal medical prescription. By prohibiting the use of drugs and restricting the use of controlled medicines, the UAE aims to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse.

Powered by Google Home Information and services About the UAE Your voice Media UAsk Beta Information and services Public holidays and religious affairs Ramadan Ramadan This page provides information about how Ramadan is observed in the UAE, charitable activities conducted and common changes one experiences during Ramadan in the UAE. What is Ramadan? How is Ramadan observed in the UAE? Events and charitable activities in Ramadan Ramadan etiquette for non-Muslims Health tips during Ramadan Consumer protection in Ramadan Report beggars Changes during Ramadan What is Ramadan? Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is regarded as the holiest month of the year as it was the month in which the Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) on the night of Laylat Al Qadr, one of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Ramadan is the month of piety, charity and blessings. During Ramadan, capable Muslims are required to abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk. Such fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. Like other months, Ramadan too begins at the first sighting of the new crescent moon and lasts 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the next crescent. The UAE follows an official announcement in this regard from the moon-sighting committee in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Makkah is considered the holiest city in the Islamic world. It is the birthplace of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and also the location where he had his first revelation of the Quran. The Islamic calendar has 354 days. Hence, Ramadan arrives 11 days earlier in every subsequent year of the Gregorian calendar. People greet each other by saying 'Ramadan Kareem', which means 'Happy Ramadan'. How is Ramadan observed in the UAE? The Ramadan traditions in the UAE start mid-Shaaban (the month preceding Ramadan). This day is known as Hagg Al-Layla. Emirati children dress in their best clothes and go to houses in the neighbouring areas reciting songs and poems. The neighbours welcome them with sweets and nuts, which is collected by children in traditional cloth bags. There are two main meals in Ramadan: Suhoor and Iftar. Suhoor is consumed early in the morning before sunrise, just before fasting hours start. Iftar is the meal to break the fast. Following the example of the Prophet Muhammad, fasting is broken with dates and laban (buttermilk) throughout the Islamic world. On the first night of Ramadan, the family gathers at the house of the male head of the family, usually the grandfather, for their first Iftar. In the UAE and the other GCC countries, dates are considered as the 'bread of the desert'. Gars, a bread-like crumble with dates and cardamom, is a popular Emirati sweet dish during Ramadan. Other common dishes are Harees and Threed. Read about where you can eat Emirati food . Firing the cannon (Midfa Al Iftar) is an integral part of the Islamic culture and takes place in many regions across the country. It can be heard around 8-10 km away. It signals the moment when Muslims can break their fast. This tradition is known to people since the rule of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founder President of the UAE. Children wait for the sound of the big bang. To them, Iftar cannon is the most fun thing that happens during this month, apart from the sweets and other special meals and activities arranged for them. Members of the UAE military carry out this tradition with appropriate safety precautions. Those who suffer certain barrier such as illness or pregnancy are not obligated to fast as per health professionals' advice. Those who were travelling may fast later. Children are not required to fast until they have reached puberty, although many still do out of choice. In addition to abstaining from eating, drinking and smoking, Muslims also should refrain from sinful speech and behaviour. In addition to the regular 5 daily prayers, Muslim men and women perform Tarawih prayers daily after Isha prayers in mid-evening. During the last ten days, many devoted Muslims spend the whole day in mosques, praying and reciting the Quran, in anticipation of the Laylat Al Qadr, the night of the first revelation of the Quran. Reciting different chapters each day from the Quran is appreciated throughout the month of Ramadan. Observing Ramadan provides a spiritual experience. It is the time for Muslims to practice self-discipline, sacrifice and empathy for the less fortunate. It encourages generosity and charity. Events and charitable activities in Ramadan The UAE hosts many interesting events to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan and the spirit of togetherness, charity and family cohesion that it brings along. Look for various social and cultural events during Ramadan in Abu Dhabi and Dubai . Find out more in the events section . Social and religious events General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments and other Islamic entities in each emirate conduct a number of religious lectures and sermons at various mosques across the country. Many world-renowned Islamic scholars are invited to enrich this spiritual month. Dubai International Holy Quran Award hosts an annual holy Quran memorisation contest. The entity also conducts lectures on Islam at various locations across the emirate. There are also the annual Holy Quran recital competitions for students and adults, where the winners earn cash prizes and more. In addition, several educational and cultural are conducted that educate the public on what the month of Ramadan is all about and how to conduct oneself during this holy month. Zakat Fund increases its campaigns during Ramadan to support and assist needy families as per its approved projects. The campaigns target: Awareness of the importance of Zakat among members of the society Introduction of the fatwa services, calculation of Zakat, and the various Zakat payment channels provided by Zakat Fund. Charitable activities Ramadan is a time for charity; giving to the less fortunate will be greatly appreciated. It doesn't have to be money, but perhaps food for Iftar. Providing free Iftar meals is a common practice across the UAE. Meals are provided at mosques, malls and other public places. Red Crescent Authority (RCA) and Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation and other charitable organisations set up tents in various locations in the UAE to offer free Iftar meals. Setting up Ramadan tents is a fundamental practice in the UAE's tradition. It reflects the spirit of giving and sharing with people from different nationalities, social status and financial backgrounds who sit together to break their fast. Tents are usually seen near mosques, in open spaces and at the entrances of some Emiratis' houses. One can experience Emirati hospitality and traditions at these tents. Many public and private organisations distribute boxes of meals, dates and water at mosques and malls daily shortly before Iftar time. They also provide foodstuff (called Al Mir Al Ramadani) to cater to the poor. RCA provides Ramadan supplies, distributes Zakat Al Fitr and Eid clothing to deserving families in the UAE and abroad. Individuals, companies and organisations interested in contributing to Red Crescent Society can do so through their counters located at mosques, shopping malls, hospitals and other public places. You can donate clothes and money through registered charitable organisations by depositing them in designated boxes located at various public places. During Ramadan, many organisations set up tents near co-operative supermarkets for receiving donations. N atural persons are not allowed to host, organise or carry out any fund-raising activity .

Read related news coverage on WAM. The UAE’s youth sector The UAE Government sees young people as its greatest assets; the foundation of the country’s future. In 2016, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, committed to putting young people’s needs and desires at the fore, by creating the position of Minister of State for Youth Affairs – a dedicated post that showed the government’s confidence in young people’s capabilities. This enabled the youth to shoulder national responsibilities, innovate and contribute to the welfare of the UAE's community. To achieve its vi sion, the UAE needs the skills, energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the country's young people, and to do that, young people’s voices must be heard, their ideas taken on, and their recommendations implemented at all government levels. The government took seriously the potential advantages of harnessing the ‘youth bulge’ in the UAE and in the region, appointing one of the youngest ministers in the world, nominated by universities from across the country. To place a young person at the helm of such an important government department was a vote of confidence in this generation’s ability to lead effectively. Emirates Youth Opportunities The ‘ Emirates Youth Opportunities’ is a unified platform that facilitates Emirati youth to access the opportunities available to them in the area of self-development and for serving the country. Several entities are expected to post about opportunities available in their organisations. Opportunities include online training, scholarships, incubators and helping in volunteering efforts to tackle COVID-19. Emirates Youth Opportunities is launched by Federal Youth Authority to help the UAE’s youth invest their time optimally under all circumstances and raise their competencies in future skills. Interactive Youth Lab Interactive Youth Lab is an innovative initiative aimed at activating the role of youth and investing their creative potential in discovering solutions and ideas for the development of government initiatives and the work of the mGovernment sector. The lab aims to enhance the role of young people and their place in decision-making and policy development, all in an interactive way. Students of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, members of the Abu Dhabi Youth Council and a distinguished group of Emirati youth participated in this lab which was launched in February 2019 by Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). Federal Youth Authority In 2018, Federal Youth Authority (FYA) was established. It was a startup initiative intended to connect every young person to every branch of government. It followed the principle of ‘Done by Youth, For Youth and With Youth’. This paved the way to make youth strategy and policy, a part of all public and private sectors. The National Youth Strategy The UAE’s National Youth Strategy looks at the five major transitions in a youth’s life in a 20-year span. From ages 15-35, youth transition through these critical stages: Education Work Adopting a healthy and safe lifestyle Starting a family Exercising their citizenship. FYA invests in youth’s energy, our most valuable resource, by nurturing their character , developing an enabling environment for their growth and development, and maximising their participation . FYA uses the metaphor of a plant to illustrate their strategy: Character in young people is like the roots of a tree, it influences everything we do. Every action, attitude and belief we take is first rooted in our character. This means that the attitudes, beliefs and choices of our youth shape our nation and our world. Character matters the most. The UAE is on a mission to cultivate character in youth that builds on our core values of inclusion, tolerance, family and commitment to excellence. The stem of the plant is the enabling environment . We provide both, a tangible and intangible environment in terms of physical spaces and enabling government policies for youth. We believe that when we invest in youth, it is similar to watering the plants and providing them with sunlight and good soil. Youth will participate by sharing their talents and skills back into the country, which will build the foundation for the next 50 years of the UAE’s development. Policies for youth The UAE Government designed many policies to make the youth take part in every sector and at all levels of governance and decision-making, and to infuse them into the national strategy as key stakeholders and actors in the country’s development. Youth Engagement Policy The UAE’s mandate is to institutionalise the whole youth sector. The UAE has made big bets on youth and believes that engaging them is the fundamental component to success in the next 50 years of development. FYA is therefore part of spearheading the Engagement policy to include the voice of the youth in everything we do. Engaging youth means three core things: Engagement is listening Engagement is data capturing Engagement is purposeful, inclusive and puts youth and their input as the core of the country’s development strategy. The UAE engages youth at regional (through the Arab Youth Centre), national and local levels. It engages its youth in all matters, and it can be evidenced in the policies and initiatives below. Emirati Youth Board Membership In June 2019, the UAE Cabinet made it mandatory for federal government entities to include young Emiratis (under 30 years old) in the Boards of Directors of their respective entities . It launched an electronic platform for those interested to register and apply to these boards, and on 3rd February 2020, Cabinet approved the appointment of 33 applicants as members of the Boards of Directors for key federal entities. The young board members serve two to three-year terms and undergo intensive training. They enjoy similar privileges and benefits as other established board members. The new members are expected to provide creative solutions for national issues and to ensure that youth are given opportunities and that their challenges are resolved at every level. Youth Councils In 2017, the UAE government developed Youth Councils as a unique tool to ensure that the youth represent their points of view and needs at all stages of the policy development process. Youth Councils were launched with an aim to nurture young leaders by giving them a key role in decision-making and in the development of policies and projects. They provide a platform for youth to lead projects in their field or their emirate. The ecosystem of the Youth Councils is crucial to implementing and executing the UAE’s National Youth Strategy. There are five Youth Councils which serve as the central form of volunteer governance over many of the Youth initiatives and points of engagement: ● Emirates Youth Council (EYC) ● Local Youth Councils (LYC) ● Global Youth Councils (GYC) ● Inter-Ministerial Councils (IMC) These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s specific ministries. ● Corporate Councils These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s private and public sector enterprises. Youth Participation in Official Delegations policy In February 2020, the UAE approved the 'Youth Participation in Official Delegations' policy, which ensures the representation of young employees in all UAE official delegations. Objectives: building leaders in the diplomatic field integrating a youth perspective into the UAE's international delegations activating the youth's role on a global scale designing a framework that supports youth representation Showcasing the character of UAE youth on the international scene promoting the UAE's soft power and highlighting the government's engagement with youth. The Youth Housing Policy On 2 June 2020, the UAE Cabinet approved the Youth Housing Awareness Policy to raise youth awareness and provide them with a host of information on the various phases of housing construction. The policy requires all young applicants (from 18 to 35 years) to complete a training course on the foundations of housing construction as a main requirement to apply for housing assistance at the local and federal level in the UAE. Federal Youth Authority also developed a ‘ Housing 101 ’ course, which provides instructions on the how to build a house – from conception to construction. View the full list of Youth Policies . Youth Initiatives Youth Circles Designed by and for the youth, Youth Circles provide two-way dialogues directly between the youth and our government, private sector and global leaders. Youth Circles are affordable, accessible and fully community-led. Organised periodically throughout different global locations, the aim of Youth Circles is to develop practical solutions, innovative ideas and effective policies and tangibly connect Youth to leadership. In Youth Circles, youth share their ideas, needs, challenges and dreams. Leaders listen, hold a dialogue and take action. Each event addresses a specific topic and the young participants try to come up with solutions and ideas through discussions and recommendations. Youth Hubs Youth Hubs are state-of-the-art spaces done by the youth, for the youth. They are collaborative work and convening spaces that connect young people throughout the UAE with the essential resources and ecosystem for growth. The mission of Youth Hub is to provide world-class resources for the youth to explore their purpose in life and pursue their potential and thrive. Resources include both, facilities and courses in various skills designed to bring out their potential. Youth Hubs are located across all the UAE and are open to young people between 15 and 35 years irrespective of whether they are students, employees or entrepreneurs. The first Youth Hub opened in Dubai in September 2017 in order to connect youth in the areas of: job creation and economic growth education and lifelong learning innovation and entrepreneurship mentoring and partnerships and health and wellness. There are currently 13 Youth Hubs around the UAE. Each Youth Hub is distinctly designed to serve the youth of that emirate, accommodating their needs and aspirations. The UAE and Arab youth In 2017, the UAE launched the Arab Youth Center (AYC) during the World Government Summit 2017. AYC is a regional youth centre in the UAE that helps to develop youth capabilities and supports innovation and creativity in the Arab world. It implements initiatives across different sectors, and conducts research amongst young Arabs to help decision-makers shape youth-friendly policies. AYC runs over 25 initiatives every year, connecting the youth to industry professionals, opening doors for them in the academic world, helping them build their businesses and much more. For the ninth year in a row, the UAE is the Arab youth's first choice for living, according to the Arab Youth Survey 2020. The UAE recognises the importance of equipping not just its own youth, but also the youth within the region. The success of the region lies in its youth, and the UAE is working closely with young Arabs to make sure their contributions to their countries have a ripple effect across borders and well into the future.

Divorce | The Official Portal of the UAE Government استمع العربية Other languages Accessibility Help Disclaimer: You are using Google Translate. The UAE mGovernment is not responsible for the accuracy of information in the translated language. Powered by Google Home Information and services About the UAE Your voice Media UAsk Beta Information and services Social affairs Divorce Divorce Divorce is an increasing social concern in the UAE. This page provides information about the divorce laws for Muslims and non-Muslims in the UAE and steps to follow for applying for divorce. Divorce laws for Muslim couples Steps for filing a divorce in the UAE Divorce laws for non-Muslim couples Children's custody Travel bans Divorce laws for Muslim couples Islamic marriages are governed by the Sharia law. If both husband and wife are Muslims and residents in the UAE, Sharia/UAE law will most likely be applied to their divorce. The same is likely if the husband is a Muslim and the woman a non-Muslim. Steps for filing a divorce in the UAE The first step is to register the case by either party at the Family Guidance Section at the respective judicial department, in one of the emirates. A court appointed conciliator will try to reconcile the divorcing parties. The conciliatory procedure is a mandatory process of the divorce proceedings in the UAE. Parties are allowed to raise their concerns pertaining to the marriage in the absence of their respective legal representatives. Amicable divorces can be concluded at this stage. Parties will need to draft a settlement based on the parties’ mutual understanding and sign it before the conciliator. If one of the parties or both of them are determined about the divorce, then the conciliator will provide the claimant with a referral letter, permitting them to proceed before the court to conclude their divorce case. The letter can be submitted to court at any time within three months from the date of issue. Once in court, the particulars of the divorce case fall at the court's discretion and each party has to provide evidence to support own claims against one another as well as in their own defence. Divorce laws for non-Muslim couples Non-Muslim expatriate residents can file for divorce in their home country (domicile) or apply for divorce in the UAE. If the parties wish to have the law of their home country applied, they may petition for this before the court. Article 1 of the Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs , as amended states: The provisions of this Law shall apply on citizens of the United Arab Emirates State unless non-Muslims among them have special provisions applicable to their community or confession. They shall equally apply to non-citizens unless one of them asks for the application of his law. This means that relevant parties may ask to apply their own laws to personal status matters. It also provides: The law of the state of which the husband is a national at the time the marriage is contracted shall apply to the effects on personal status and the effects with regards to property resulting from contracting of the marriage. Whenever the law of the parties' home country fails to cover an aspect of the divorce procedure, the courts hold discretion to apply the UAE law. Children's custody According to Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs, the biological mother of the child is the custodian and the father is the guardian. Custody involves day-to-day care of the child, which is usually granted to the mother without interfering with the right of guardianship awarded to the father. At all times, the father is responsible for providing for the child financially. He is responsible for providing shelter, expenses for food, medical care, education and other necessities. Custody and guardianship are two separate issues that must be addressed individually as parents do not share equal responsibilities for a child in the UAE. The courts always act in the best interests of the child and therefore, unless given reason to believe otherwise, they keep him in the physical custody of the mother, whilst being under the guardian's (father's) supervision. Article 156 of Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs provides that a child's custody under the mother ends when their son reaches the age of 11 and when their daughter reaches the age of 13. The father being the guardian can claim the custody thereafter. As set out in Article 143 and 144 of the law, a custodian must be: Rational Mature enough and have attained the age of puberty Honest Able to bring up and take care of a child Free from infectious disease Not have been sentenced for a crime of 'honour'. If the custodian is the mother, she must: Not remarry unless the court decides it's in the best interests of the child Share the same religion as the child. If the custodian is the father, he must: Have a suitable woman living in his home to care for the child (such as a female relative) Share the same religion as the child. The mother also has the right to claim the extension of the custody period until their son finishes his education and their daughter gets married. In this case, the mother has to prove that she has been good with the children i.e. through their school performance reports, good medical health history etc. The father can claim the custody of their son if he feels that their son is becoming too soft in nature by staying with the mother and that he would want him to grow up to be more responsible. In both circumstances, the judge will decide the case. Travel bans A custodian cannot travel with the child without the guardian's approval and vice-versa. Fleeing with the child without the consent of the other parent, could amount to child abduction. The parent abducting the child can face serious legal consequences for such action. If either parent has concerns, they can obtain a travel ban preventing the child from leaving the airport. If there is a dispute, the matter can be referred to a judge.

In the area of empowering communities: Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives holds conferences and grants awards to innovative individuals in the fields of media, art and sports. To date, half a million people have been touched through these initiatives; 67,000 of them are media personnel who have contributed to opening new horizons for media in the region. The Foundation is further concerned with consolidating a cultural discourse characterised by tolerance through investing half a billion AED in cultural understanding initiatives, which have benefited more than 200 nationalities.

Having in mind that approximately 780 million people are without access to a clean source of water and millions die every year from diarrhoea caused by unclean water, the Humanitarian Accelerators will look for solutions to create cost-effective technology that can purify water efficiently, quickly and in large quantities and delivered to the most affected communities. Considering that the rising number of refugees living in poverty, the Humanitarian Accelerators will focus on finding electronic solutions and developing a platform for e-business in order to give refugees a platform to leverage their skills, capabilities and services online, thus providing them with tangible economic opportunities. Given the below-average Arabic online content, the Humanitarian Accelerators will devise electronic solutions to increase the amount and quality of Arabic content online.

Benefits of open government data and guidelines What is open government data? Government data that is freely available for anyone to use, reuse, distribute or share with others without restrictions is called open government data. As per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018 (PDF, 2 MB) , open government data is government information proactively disclosed and made available online for all to access, without restriction. Benefits of open government data Disclosing government data brings transparency in government transactions and makes them accountable for their actions. It facilitates public scrutiny and evaluation of government performance. Open data helps in efficient use of resources, designing customised service delivery and creation of more jobs. It helps people to make informed decisions about public policies and identify development opportunities. Through all its endeavours, open government data helps to achieve the SDGs . A document issued by World Bank (PDF, 1.5 MB) estimates the direct, annual economic value of open government data in two different studies as up to 40 billion euros throughout the European Union and close to 2 billion pounds in the UK. Increasingly many countries have launched an open data portal. In 2014, just 46 countries had an open data portal. However, in 2018, 139 countries had an open data portal as per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018. The UAE has two data portals: UAE Numbers and Bayanat . The World Bank document brings out the key benefits of open data which are: Fostering in economic growth and job creation. Open data can promote economic growth by helping launch new businesses, create new jobs, increase efficiency in existing organisations and generally improve the climate for foreign investment. Improving efficiency, effectiveness and coverage of public services Open data can help strengthen healthcare systems by connecting patients to providers, promote education and ongoing learning, and relieve hunger and improve food security on both a large and small scale. Increasing transparency, accountability and citizen participation Open data can expose and prevent mismanagement and corruption. It also helps ensure environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and build resilience to climate change. Facilitating better information sharing within the government Open data can help improve cities and urban infrastructure. It is key to high-tech smart cities, modern urban planning and the transformation of urban transportation. It can also improve resilience to disasters and ensure that critical resources will be deployed well in emergencies.
